When you think of “home,” what comes to mind? Is it the place you were born, grew up, or live now? How long has that been home to you? Do you have more than one home? The concept of “home” is rather tricky to pin down. Unlike a house – which is pretty much any basic unit of dwelling – a home is much broader, deeper, and more personal.
